# Sri-Lanka-Administrative-Districts
Sri Lanka has 25 administrative districts, grouped under nine provinces. Each district is governed by a District Secretary and further divided into Divisional Secretariats and Grama Niladhari divisions.  These districts, like Colombo, Kandy, and Jaffna, are essential for local governance and development across the country.
